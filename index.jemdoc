== Biography
I am currently a 3rd-year PhD Student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, 
under the supervision of Prof. [https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/en/yongxia.html Yong Xia]. 
I am also a visiting student at the School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide (UoA), Australia, under the supervision of Prof. [https://cshen.github.io/ Chunhua Shen]. 

My research interests mainly focus on deep learning technologies for medical image analysis, 
especially annotation-limited 3D medical image segmentation. 


==== I am looking for a post-doc position or a medical-AI related job!
