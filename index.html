<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am currently a 2rd-year postgraduate Student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University (SMU), China, 
under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://portal.smu.edu.cn/swyxgcxy/info/1020/1241.htm">Yu Zhang</a>. </p>
<p>My research interests mainly focus on deep learning technologies for medical image analysis, 
especially annotation-limited 3D medical image segmentation. </p>
<h4>I am looking for a post-doc position or a medical-AI related job!</h4>
